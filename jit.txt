JIT advantages:
  Compare to interpreter
    IR is almost same size to source code
    MI can be one-time-compiled and run it again and again
  Better performance than static compilation, as many optimizations are only feasible at run-time
    Run time binding languages (dynamic/late binding)
    Choose SSE2 vector CPU instructions
    Static compilation uses profile+recompilation; JIT no need recompilation

Compile Java language to Byte code is slow, but compile Byte code to machine code is fast.
Compile high level languages to llvm ir is slow, but compile llvm ir to machine code is fast.
